thread.c
 - add function : bool compare_waketime()
 - add function which returns the minimum local wake_time : min_waketime()
   used at timer_interrupt() as a conditional 
 - adjust add_to_sleep() : now sleep list is sorted by wake_time ascending order

timer.c 
 
 - timer_interrupt() : add condition to call wakeup_thread; call when (current tick) >= (minimum wake_time) AND sleep_list isn't empty (min_waketime() != 0)
